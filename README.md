# Image-Processing-IPs
This repository contains files for an image processing hardware project. It leverages Xilinx tools and IP cores for efficient image manipulation and processing tasks. It aims to implement key image processing algorithms on an FPGA, providing a hardware-accelerated solution for tasks such as filtering and edge detection.

# Project Structure
+ <u>RTL/Verilog Code</u>: Contains the Verilog source code for implementing the image processing algorithms at the hardware level. These modules include processing blocks such as filters, image transformation logic, and parallel processing units.

+ <u>Simulation</u>: Simulation files and testbenches used to verify the functionality of the Verilog code before hardware implementation. The simulation ensures correctness, performance, and timing validation.

+ <u>Xilinx IPs</u>: Pre-configured and custom Xilinx IP cores used in the project. These may include DMA controllers, memory interfaces, and other image processing accelerators.

+ <u>Constraints & Configuration Files</u>: Configuration and constraint files used to map the design to specific Xilinx FPGA hardware, ensuring correct pin assignments, clock constraints, and resource utilization.
Documentation: Provides detailed descriptions of the design, setup instructions, and usage guidelines for simulation and hardware deployment.
